# Culinary

The cooking website was created for educational purposes on Ruby on Rails

Creation of a dynamic culinary website featuring a minimum viable product (MVP) that aims to inspire food enthusiasts by providing a vast collection of recipes, cooking tips, and engaging culinary content. The culinary website's functionality, design, and collaboration aspects were improved through the utilization of primary technologies such as Ruby on Rails, RubyMine, Bootstrap, and Git. As a full-stack developer, I played a pivotal role in the project, contributing to both front-end and back-end development.
